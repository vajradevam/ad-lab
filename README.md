# Applications Development Laboratory

## Overview

Welcome to the Applications Development Laboratory! This lab focuses on the development of applications with a strong emphasis on Machine Learning (ML). Under the guidance of Dr. Jyotiprakash Mishra, this lab aims to provide students and researchers with hands-on experience in building, deploying, and optimizing machine learning models for real-world applications.

The lab is designed to foster innovation and practical skills in the field of machine learning, covering a wide range of topics including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this lab offers a collaborative environment to explore cutting-edge technologies and methodologies in ML.

## Lab Resources

*   **Software Tools:**
    *   Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
    *   Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code
    *   Docker for containerization
*   **Datasets:**
    *   Access to publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle, UCI ML Repository)
    *   Custom datasets for specific projects
*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-performance computing resources

## Getting Started

*   **Set Up Your Environment:**
    *   Install Python 3.x and required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow torch flask
    ```

    *   Set up a virtual environment for your projects.
    *   Install more libraries as required.
*   **Install Docker:**
    *   Follow the official Docker installation guide for your operating system: [Docker Installation Guide](Docker Installation Guide)
    *   Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

*   **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vajradevam/ad-lab.git
    cd ad-lab
    ```

*   **Explore Tutorials and Projects:**
    *   Dive into the `day{x}/` directory for hands-on ML applications.
*   **Build and Run Docker Containers:**
    *   Create a `Dockerfile` for your project:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.8-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    COPY . .
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]
    ```

    Or use the one provided.

    *   Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t your-image-name .
    ```

    *   Run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app -it your-image-name
    ```

    `docker-compose` can be set up for easy startup of the container.

*   **Contribute:**
    *   Fork the repository and submit pull requests for new features or improvements.
    *   Report issues or suggest enhancements in the Issues section.

## Lab Guidelines

*   **Code of Conduct:** Respect all lab members and maintain a collaborative environment.
*   **Documentation:** Ensure all code is well-documented for easy understanding and reproducibility.
*   **Experimentation:** Feel free to experiment with new ideas and technologies.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your supervisor informed about your progress and challenges.
